    <h1>California COVID-19 Vaccination Data</h1>
    <p>The State of California currently publishes COVID-19 vaccination data for the state as a whole and for each county, but is not in a useful, machine-readable format and it is only a current, point-in-time snapshot, with no history. This site hosts data files that are built by scraping the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/">state website</a> once a day.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="./current.v1.json">A current snapshot of vaccinations is at <code>current.v1.json</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="./timeseries.v1.json">A timeseries of vaccinations in newline-delimited JSON format is at <code>timeseries.v1.json</code></a></li>
    </ul>
